# Space-Travel-Agency

Draft of a space travel site using CSS keyframes triggered by JavaScript.

Clicking "Let's go" prompts the user to decide whether or not to be launched into space. Typing "yes" triggers an animation but has no further function at this time.

Long load time because of large image used to create rotating Earth effect.
